      <h2>SQL functions, written in Jinja</h2>
      <p>
        A macro is a reusable snippet of SQL with parameters. Anything between{" "}
        <code>{"{% … %}"}</code> or <code>{"{{ … }}"}</code> in a model is Jinja — dbt
        renders it to plain SQL before Snowflake sees it. You have been using macros
        from the start: <code>ref()</code> and <code>source()</code> are macros. The
        project keeps shared ones in <code>macros/</code>.
      </p>

      <h2>A familiar pain point: organisation codes</h2>
      <p>
        Provider, practice and ICB codes arrive in inconsistent forms. Feeds often carry
        site-level codes with suffixes (<code>RRP00</code>) where reference data holds
        the parent organisation (<code>RRP</code>) — so joins to the organisation
        dictionary quietly return nothing. The project handles this once, in a macro:
      </p>
      <CodeBlock
        lang="sql"
        title="any model that joins on organisation codes"
        code={`
select
    {{ clean_organisation_id('provider_code') }} as provider_code,
    ...
from {{ ref('stg_some_activity_feed') }}
`}
      />
      <p>
        <code>clean_organisation_id()</code> keeps the code if it is a recognised
        organisation, and otherwise falls back to the 3-character parent code. Every
        model that uses it resolves codes the same way — and when the rule needs to
        change, it changes in one place.
      </p>

      <h2>Another example: age attributes</h2>
      <p>
        The same principle applies to derivations. Instead of each model defining its
        own age bands:
      </p>
      <CodeBlock
        lang="sql"
        code={`
select
    person_id,
    {{ calculate_age_attributes('birth_date', 'current_date()') }}
from {{ ref('stg_olids_patient') }}
`}
      />
      <p>
        One call expands into <code>age</code>, <code>age_band_5y</code>,{" "}
        <code>age_band_10y</code>, <code>age_band_nhs</code>, <code>age_band_ons</code>,{" "}
        <code>life_stage</code> and school-age flags — consistent across every model,
        with the band boundaries defined once.
      </p>

      <h2>Writing your own</h2>
      <p>
        A macro definition is the SQL you would have written, with the varying parts
        as parameters. A realistic small example — a standard “not yet ended” filter
        used across effective-dated reference tables:
      </p>
      <CodeBlock
        lang="sql"
        title="macros/transformations/is_active_record.sql (illustrative)"
        code={`
{% macro is_active_record(start_date_col, end_date_col, as_of='current_date()') %}
    {{ start_date_col }} <= {{ as_of }}
    and ({{ end_date_col }} is null or {{ end_date_col }} > {{ as_of }})
{% endmacro %}
`}
      />
      <CodeBlock
        lang="sql"
        title="used in a model"
        code={`
select organisation_code, organisation_name
from {{ ref('stg_dictionary_dbo_organisation') }}
where {{ is_active_record('open_date', 'close_date') }}
`}
      />
      <p>Practical notes when writing one:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Parameters arrive as text.</strong>{" "}
          <code>start_date_col</code> is the string <code>open_date</code> pasted into
          the SQL — the macro never sees data, only names. Defaults (like{" "}
          <code>as_of</code> above) keep the common case short.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Debug with <code>dbt compile</code>.</strong> If a macro misbehaves,
          read the rendered SQL — the mistake is usually visible immediately in the
          expansion.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Navigate with the editor.</strong> In VS Code, go-to-definition on
          any macro call opens its source — the fastest way to learn what the existing
          macros actually do.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Place it with its peers.</strong> Shared macros live in{" "}
          <code>macros/</code>, grouped by purpose (<code>transformations/</code>,{" "}
          <code>governance/</code>, <code>qof_registers/</code>…). A macro used by one
          model probably should not exist yet — inline it until the rule of three says
          otherwise.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <Callout kind="tip" title="The rule of three">
        <p>
          Pasting the same logic into a third model is the signal to stop — it should
          become a macro (or an <code>int_</code> model, if it is more data than logic).
          Ask in review if unsure; promoting logic later is harder than starting it in
          the right place.
        </p>
      </Callout>

      <Callout kind="warn">
        <p>
          Macros are rendered <em>before</em> the SQL runs — they can respond to
          arguments and project configuration, but not to data. Logic that needs to read
          rows to make decisions belongs in a model, not a macro.
