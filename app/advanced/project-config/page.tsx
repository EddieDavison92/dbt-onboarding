      <h2>One file, all the defaults</h2>
      <p>
        <code>dbt_project.yml</code> at the repo root configures every model by{" "}
        <strong>folder path</strong>. An abridged view of ours:

      <p>
        Read it top-down: settings cascade from project → folder → subfolder, with
        deeper levels winning. The <code>+</code> prefix marks a config property (as
        opposed to a folder name).
      </p>

      <h2>The hierarchy</h2>
      <p>When the same setting is defined in more than one place, the most specific wins:</p>
      <table>
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>Level</th>
            <th>Example</th>
            <th>Wins over</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td>
              <code>config()</code> in the model file
            </td>
            <td>
              <code>{"{{ config(materialized='view') }}"}</code>
            </td>
            <td>everything below</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Folder in dbt_project.yml</td>
            <td>
              <code>staging: +materialized: view</code>
            </td>
            <td>project default</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Project default</td>
            <td>
              <code>+materialized: table</code>
            </td>
            <td>dbt&apos;s built-in default</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
      <p>
        This is why your staging model file contains only a SELECT: location does the
        configuring. It is also why <strong>putting a file in the right folder is a
        real decision</strong> — it sets materialisation, database, schema, tags and
        post-hooks in one move.
      </p>

      <h2>Tags drive the schedules</h2>
      <p>
        Those <code>+tags</code> are not decoration. The nightly build selects models by
        tag — <code>daily</code>-tagged layers rebuild every night; heavier marts run on
        their own cadence. You can use them too:
      </p>
      <CodeBlock
        lang="bash"
        code={`
dbt build -s tag:daily          # everything in the nightly selection
dbt ls -s tag:reporting         # list models carrying a tag
`}
      />

      <h2>Variables: one value, overridable per run</h2>
      <p>
        Some values need to be consistent everywhere but changeable for a single run —
        reference dates are the project&apos;s main example. The QOF reference date is
        defined once and read through a macro; every register model calls{" "}
        <code>{"{{ qof_reference_date() }}"}</code> rather than hardcoding a date. To
        rebuild a register as of a different date, override it at the command line:
      </p>
      <CodeBlock
        lang="bash"
        code={`
dbt build -s fct_person_diabetes_register --vars '{"qof_reference_date": "2025-03-31"}'
`}
      />
      <p>
        One definition in normal use, an explicit override when you need to rewind —
        and the override is visible in the command, not hidden in an edited file.
      </p>

      <h2>Post-hooks: governance on autopilot</h2>
      <p>
        The project-level <code>+post-hook</code> runs after every model build —
        transferring ownership so the right roles can manage the object. Published
        models add hooks for Snowflake governance tags. You get all of this without
        writing a line: it is the layer doing the work.
      </p>

      <Callout kind="info" title="Schemas from folders (OLIDS)">
        <p>
          In the OLIDS domain a custom <code>generate_schema_name</code> macro derives
          the schema from the folder path —{" "}
          <code>models/modelling/olids/diagnoses/</code> builds into{" "}
          <code>MODELLING.OLIDS_DIAGNOSES</code> with no config at all. Creating a
          folder is creating a schema.

      <Callout kind="warn" title="Touching dbt_project.yml is a wide-radius change">
        <p>
          A one-line edit here can re-materialise hundreds of models. If your change
          needs it, say so prominently in the PR — and expect the review to involve more
          people than usual.
